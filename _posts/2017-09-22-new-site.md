If you've tried visiting within the last, oh I don't know... year or so, you were probably met with a browser error. Yes, I suppose when you have a steady job and aren't looking for work, and your personal web server goes down, there's not a huge reason to get it back up quickly, and then it can be easily forgotten.

But since I am a web developer, I figured I should have a website. It was also a great time to try out something other than WordPress, so here I am. This is a static site, it's hosted on Amazon S3, built with Jekyll. I also decided on the [Flexible-Jekyll](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll) theme by David Freeman, and the first image to grace the new website is from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/bicycle-bike-brakes-classic-369264/) from the generous [Markus Spiske](https://www.pexels.com/u/markusspiske/).
